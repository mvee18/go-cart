* TODO add case for files found but no energy in readoutput, like in sempirical
  - more difficult because there may be no clear error or MOPAC DONE to check against

  - start checking for resources
  - spent all day trying to figure out, might need different approach
    
* tried setting sleep in queueandsubmit to 100 ms and something broke
  - not sure if caused by that but that is the first crash ive seen 

* zero values below some threshold - hold off for now, see later

* figure out how higher order derivatives are written in output
  
* current time is 11m 8s for 2nd derivatives of water
