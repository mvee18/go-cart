* TODO figure out how higher order derivatives are written in output

* TODO Delete files after reading - post job processing error, deleting too fast I think
  - doesnt seem to affect the values I want, so should be okay, just a lot of logs
  - this is back to not working since it was making too many syscalls

* zero values below some threshold - hold off for now, see later
  
* Advice from irc
  <dominikh> anyway, NumGoroutine isn't really a useful metric for avoiding
  hitting the limit. I'd just have a semaphore (easiest implemented
  as a buffered channel). acquire before spawning a goroutine,
  release when a goroutine returns, and hope things work out
    
* if I need more signals just use combinations of them
  - two signals gives 900 unique combos compared to 30 of one
